Attention !
-------------------

in preparation for next week, please read chapter  3 "Linear Regression", chapter 4 "Classification" and chapter 6 "Linear Model Selection and Regularization" from Gareth James et.al. book  "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R".  You can find the book here: http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ 
In the end of each chapters there are short "labs" that illustrate how to implement chapter material in R. I recommend to look through them too.
